<H1>IOT_Arduino_based_Laser_Security_Device</H1>
Its an IOT based Laser security device which switch on buzzer as well as sends a Notification on Owners device when someone interrupts the connection between Laser and LDR

This is prototype of A laser alarm system based on arduino and an software named "Blynk",
which help to send notification from ESP-32 to your mobile device.

<h2>Working:</h2><p>

LDR, the system immediately starts alarm and sends a notification to the owners mobile through
Blynk system.
